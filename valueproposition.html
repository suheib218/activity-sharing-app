          <h3>Value Proposition</h3>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            People often face difficulty organizing spontaneous activities with
            friends due to poor communication, lack of a centralized planning
            tool, and time constraints. Social platforms are not specifically
            designed for managing events, and the constant back-and-forth makes
            it difficult to quickly plan and execute activities. This leads to
            missed opportunities for social engagement and frustration among
            users.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            The Activity Sharing App provides an easy-to-use platform for
            creating, sharing, and managing events in real time. With features
            that allow users to create activities with a few clicks, join
            events, and coordinate effortlessly with friends, the app eliminates
            the stress of planning spontaneous activities. Whether it's a quick
            coffee meeting or a weekend outing, users can stay connected and
            ensure their plans come together smoothly.
          </p>

          <h4>Target group</h4>
          <p>
            My target group includes socially active individuals, particularly
            young professionals, students, and groups of friends looking for
            quick and easy ways to plan events. Additionally, the app appeals to
            small communities or clubs that need a tool for managing and sharing
            activities without the complexity of formal scheduling apps. The app
            is also useful for anyone who values efficiency in organizing their
            social life.
