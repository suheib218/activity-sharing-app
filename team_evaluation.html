                <p>
                    As the sole member of the project, I, Suheib Saaid, am responsible for all aspects of development. 
                    I reached the **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** for the Activity Manager App, successfully implementing essential features such as **user authentication**, **activity creation**, **participation**, and **activity listing**. 
                    
                    Additionally, I integrated SQLite for data persistence, allowing the app to save and retrieve user and activity data effectively.

                    Two features I couldn't implement in the MVP due to time constraints were **activity notifications** and **Google Maps integration**. These were planned for later stages but had to be postponed to meet the MVP deadline.

                    Apart from the development, I enhanced my proficiency with **GitHub**, utilizing features like push, pull requests, and branching to manage the project efficiently.
                </p>

                <h2 id="how-we-would-improve-next-time">How We Would Improve Next Time</h2>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on this project, there are areas where I could improve in the future. One significant area is **project planning**. Initially, I struggled with setting realistic goals and milestones, which slowed progress at the beginning. Better planning from the start would have streamlined development.
                    
                    On the technical side, maintaining a more **consistent code style** and ensuring **thorough documentation** for all features would help the project scale better in future iterations. I will also aim to define features more precisely and stick to the **project scope** to avoid spending time on unnecessary enhancements.
                </p>

                <h2 id="peer-review">Peer Review</h2>
                <p>
                    As this was a solo project, there was no peer review from other team members. However, I conducted regular **self-reviews** to assess progress and check the quality of the code, testing each feature after implementation. I also took time to ensure the project met the objectives outlined in the MVP and handled any challenges or issues that arose efficiently.
                </p>

                <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    Since I was the sole developer on this project, I contributed to all aspects, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Designed and implemented the activity creation, user authentication, and activity participation functionality using Python and SQLite.</li>
                    <li><strong>Frontend Development:</strong> Developed the user interface with basic HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for activity listing, filtering, and user interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Integrated SQLite for persistent data storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub Management:</strong> Managed the repository, branches, and pull requests independently to ensure smooth progression of the project.</li>
                </ul>
