                <p>
                    At the beginning of my project, I quickly found an idea that I wanted to implement. However, I soon realized that I had to make many essential decisions that required careful consideration and discussion. It took me some time to find solutions that aligned with my original idea while remaining feasible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, I decided to use Flask for the backend development, but I also considered FastAPI for its potential advantages. After weighing the pros and cons, I concluded that Flask would be the best choice for this project, given my familiarity with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the frontend, I had to choose between custom CSS or a framework like Bootstrap. Ultimately, I opted for Bootstrap to ensure a user-friendly design that could be easily maintained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the early phases of development, I also focused on defining the database models. It took some time to finalize the registration fields, login processes, and other essential functionalities. However, I made sure to incorporate feedback from potential users to enhance the overall user experience.
                </p>

                <h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    Throughout the project, I pushed my code to the repository after completing various features, resulting in over 7 to 8 total commits. This iterative process allowed me to keep track of changes and improvements effectively. Each commit represented a step forward in refining the application, ensuring that I could roll back to previous versions if needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I learned valuable lessons about decision-making, the importance of user feedback, and the benefits of using version control in software development. These insights will undoubtedly benefit future projects.
                </p>

                <h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>
                <p>
                    As I move towards the final stages of development, I am preparing to test the application thoroughly. This includes verifying all functionalities, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing performance. Additionally, I will focus on enhancing the user interface based on feedback gathered during the testing phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the sole member of this project, I have taken on multiple roles, from backend development to UI/UX design. This has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to grow my skills and create a product that I am proud of.
